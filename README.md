# Inventory Management System Database Project

This project provides a scalable MySQL database solution tailored for an Inventory Management System. It aims to optimize performance, ensure data integrity, and maintain all normalization forms for efficient operations.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to deliver a robust MySQL database solution that enhances the functionality and efficiency of an Inventory Management System. By providing a scalable and optimized database structure while maintaining all normalization forms, the objective is to streamline operations, improve performance, and ensure data integrity throughout the system.

## Features

- **Scalable Design**: The database structure is designed to grow with the system's needs.
- **Data Integrity**: Implements validation protocols and constraints for reliable data management.
- **Normalization**: Maintains all normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, 4NF,5NF) to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.
